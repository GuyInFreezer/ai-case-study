Clearview.AI is a company that focuses on AI-powered facial recognition software that was established in 2017 that is based in New York City.. The company was co-founded by **Hoan Ton-That** and **Richard Schwartz**. There isn't any information found on how the company came about, since the company was operating under secrecy for undisclosed amount of time, but given the purpose of the company, it is best assumed to aid the law enforcements to better identify the perpetrator and victims of criminal activities. The last publicly announced funding received is back in July 2021, where the company received 30 million dollars worth of Series B funding round. Crunchbase result shows that the company also received Series C funding back in 2022, but the amount received is undisclosed.

> We aim to help protect the public through processes that are consistent with protecting fundamental freedoms and human rights. We have developed and applied best practices to all uses and every user of our identity solutions.

Clearview AI offers top-of-the-technology facial recognition software intended for the law enforcement agents to easily identify perpetuators and victims of any criminal activities. They also look to reach out to more private sectors, such as school network.

According to the interview done by Washington Post in April 2022, Clearview AI's database contains over 20 billion images that are scraped only from the public without bias, and explicitly works with law enforcements which totals up to over 3,000 agencies. The interview shows that Clearview AI's algorithm ranked second from over 650 algorithms worldwide and first in US tested by *NIST* (National Institute of Standard and Technology), which gives the comapny a huge advantage when being chosen by the law enforcement agencies.

## Landscape

As mentioned earlier, Clearview AI focuses on providing facial recognition technologies to law enforcement in order to aid crime investigation and prevention. Research showed that while there are many other companies that provide facial recognition softwares, Clearview AI was the only company that specifically targets law enforcement for their facial recognition services.

## Results

Clearview AI's so-called "unconsented" image scraping from social media posts caused an uproar, albeit the scraping was only done from public posts. Clearview AI only recently won their appeal in UK court from $9 million fine for the breach of data protection and privacy.

This appeal victory sets up an important precedence in terms of morality of scraping photos and dats from public posts, which is bound to promote legal data scraping for facial recognition databases.

While any information on how the algorithm is written or what technology is being used for is unavailable on public, most likely due to its connection to law enforcement, ranking first in US and it being used by various law enforcement agencies that includes FBI and CIA, and having basically no alternative in this specific usage of the software assures the company's huge success.

## Recommendations

Given the company's huge success in providing precise and fast facial recognition, offering their services to public schools could definitely help the company's goal of reducing criminal activities since many public schools tend to be the target of criminal activities such as shooting.
