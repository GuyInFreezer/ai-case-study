Clearview.AI is a company that focuses on AI-powered facial recognition software that was established in 2017 that is based in New York City.. The company was co-founded by **Hoan Ton-That** and **Richard Schwartz**. There isn't any information found on how the company came about, since the company was operating under secrecy for undisclosed amount of time, but given the purpose of the company, it is best assumed to aid the law enforcements to better identify the perpetrator and victims of criminal activities. The last publicly announced funding received is back in July 2021, where the company received 30 million dollars worth of Series B funding round. Crunchbase result shows that the company also received Series C funding back in 2022, but the amount received is undisclosed.
